This project is the capstone of a edx.org course called "Data Science with R" provided by HarvardX.

For this capstone, the idea is to apply machine learning techniques that go beyond standard linear regression.
In UCI Machine Learning Repository, the Water Quality Prediction challenge was choosen.

The project, realised with R, propose some techniques to predict the value of water quality for the next depending on predictors of the actual day.
